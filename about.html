                <p class="mission__text">
                    FlowState was born from a simple observation: productivity isn't one-size-fits-all. Your emotional state profoundly impacts how you work, what motivates you, and what helps you recharge. Traditional productivity tools ignore this fundamental truth.
                </p>
                <p class="mission__text">
                    We created FlowState to bridge that gap‚Äîa platform that recognizes you're human, with changing moods and needs throughout your day. By combining mood-based content curation with proven productivity techniques like the Pomodoro method, we help you work with your natural rhythms, not against them.
